## Chris's Gatekeeper

### Introduction
Hello! If you are reading this, you are a staff member on Chris's Discord server and Minecraft housings.

All staff members should learn how to use our custom-made bot, Chris's Gatekeeper.

If you ever need any help, or you discover a bug, DM core#8531 or GhostlyCoding#4665 on Discord with your question or bug report, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.

### Chapter 1. All the commands
The bot only has a few commands. The bots prefix is `.`, and this **cannot** be changed. Details on all commands are below. Some commands have sub-commands, also detailed below.

Anything inside angle brackets (`<>`) is a **required paramater**. Anything inside square brackets (`[]`) are **optional**. If inside one of these brackets you see multiple things
with  a `|` in between them, you have to choose **one** of them to put there.
